Before start, make sure you meet these requirements:

* You have installed and configured a  `MySQL client`.


## üöÄ Installing and Configuring

To install UserAPI, follow these steps:

Clone the project and run the command in the root directory:
```
npm install
```
<br>

Change the file <code>.envexample</code> with your environment variables:
```
## database config
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_USER=user
DB_PWD=password
DB_NAME=database

## E-mail trigger config
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=465
EMAIL_USER=youremail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=123456
## if your SMTP server didn't use SSL/TLS put false

After that, rename the file to <code>.env</code>

## ‚òï Using the UserAPI.

 Run the server with this line in the command line:
```
node index.js
```
(I recommend `nodemon` to server auto-restart after changes)

Test and enjoy! üòÖ
